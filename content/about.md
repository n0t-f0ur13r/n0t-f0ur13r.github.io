## 👋 I'm Josué Leiva

I am a **Civil Telematics Engineering** student at **UTFSM** (Chile), currently navigating my second year. unlike the typical engineering path, I found my passion in **Mathematical Logic** and **Abstract Algorithms** rather than pure physics.

My journey is defined by a desire to understand *how* things work at the lowest level—from the electrical signals in an ESP32 to the memory allocation in a C++ kernel.

### 🛠️ My Digital Workbench
I believe tools shape the way we think. Here is my daily driver setup:

| Category | Tool of Choice | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **OS** | **Linux (Ubuntu)** | Total control over the system resources. |
| **Editor** | **Neovim** | Editing at the speed of thought. Mouse-free workflow. |
| **Languages** | **C++, Python** | C++ for power and control; Python for speed and glue. |
| **Hardware** | **ESP32, RPi** | Bridging the gap between software and the physical world. |

### 🎯 Current Focus
I am actively looking for **Remote Internship / Entry-Level** positions where I can apply my knowledge in:
* Embedded Systems & IoT.
* Backend Logic (Python/Django).
* Systems Programming (C/C++).

### 🌱 Outside the Terminal
When I'm not resolving segmentation faults, you can find me:
* Folding complex **Origami** models.
* Shooting **Analog Photography** (capturing light on film requires as much patience as debugging).
* Practicing **Calligraphy**.
