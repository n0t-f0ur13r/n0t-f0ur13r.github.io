## 👋 I'm Josué Leiva

I am a **Civil Telematics Engineering** student at **UTFSM** (Chile), just finished flying my second year. 
Unlike the typical engineering path, I have found deep love for **Mathematics** and **Probability**.
 
My journey is defined by a desire to understand *how* things work at the lowest level—from the electrical signals in an ESP32 to the memory allocation in a C++ kernel.

Above all, I keep **God** (Jesus) as the foundation for every purpose and pursuit in my life.

### 🛠️ My Digital Workbench
The tools must be appropriate to the thinking process. Here is my daily driver setup:

| Category | Tool of Choice | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **OS** | **Linux (Ubuntu)** | Flexible, fast, and it is simple to use and customise. |
| **Editor** | **Vim** | Mouse-free workflow for a cleaner thinking process. (No plugins, just pure editing). |
| **IDE** | **VS Code** | Used strictly for complex heavy projects or managing **PlatformIO** environments. |
| **Languages** | **C++, Python** | C++ for power and memory control; Python for speed and glue logic. |
| **Hardware** | **ESP32, RPi** | Bridging the gap between software and the physical world. |

### 🎯 Current Focus (Internship Goals)
I am actively looking for **Remote Internship / Entry-Level** positions.
My goal is not just to write code, but to **learn industry standards** and contribute to engineering teams working on:

* **Embedded Systems:** Moving from prototypes to production-grade firmware.
* **Full Stack development:** There is always a project that needs a Web Application.
* **Backend Development:** Strengthening my logic in Python/Django architectures.
* **Systems Programming:** Applying my C/C++ foundation to real-world constraints.

*I offer a disciplined mind, a hunger for difficult problems, and a solid grasp of Computer Science fundamentals.*

### 📚 Currently Self-Studying
I am currently studying:
* **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automating workflows with GitHub Actions.
* **Math Refresh:** Re-visiting Multivariable Calculus and ODEs.
* **Advanced Web:** Deepening Django ORM knowledge.
* **Financial Literacy:** Must know how to manage my resources just like the stack memory.

### 🔭 The Long Term Vision
As I progress in my degree, I aim to specialize in the intersection of math and hardware:
* Stochastic Processes & Probability.
* Edge Computing & IIoT.
* Numerical Methods.
* Control Theory.

### 🌱 Outside the Terminal
When I'm not resolving segmentation faults, you can find me:
* Practicing **Calligraphy**.
* Folding **Origami** models.
* Shooting **Digital Photography**.

*Someday will go after Analog Photography...*
