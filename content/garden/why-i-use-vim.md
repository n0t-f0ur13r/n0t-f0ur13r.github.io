Leaving VS Code was hard, but necessary.

The modal editing nature of Vim allows me to edit code at the "speed of thought". 
Instead of reaching for the mouse to highlight a line, 
I simply press `dd`. And the speed of the homerow is a delight.

It's not just about speed; it's about **reducing friction** between my brain and the codebase.
It is about keeping the environment simple to focus in solving the problem, writing the right lines.
